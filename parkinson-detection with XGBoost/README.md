# Detecting Parkinson’s Disease – Python Machine Learning Project

### What is Parkinson’s Disease?
**Parkinson's disease** (**PD**), or simply **Parkinson's** is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. The symptoms usually emerge slowly and, as the disease worsens, non-motor symptoms become more common. The most obvious early symptoms are tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking, but cognitive and behavioral problems may also occur. Parkinson's disease dementia becomes common in the advanced stages of the disease. Depression and anxiety are also common, occurring in more than a third of people with PD. Other symptoms include sensory, sleep, and emotional problems. The main motor symptoms are collectively called "parkinsonism", or a "parkinsonian syndrome".

### What is XGBoost?
**XGBoost** is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly **efficient**, **flexible** and **portable**. It implements machine learning algorithms under the [Gradient Boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way. The same code runs on major distributed environment (Hadoop, SGE, MPI) and can solve problems beyond billions of examples.

### Dataset for this project
You’ll need the UCI ML Parkinsons dataset for this; you can  [_**Download Dataset**_](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/). The dataset has 24 columns and 195 records and is only 39.7 KB.
