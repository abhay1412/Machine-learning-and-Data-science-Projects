# Image Classification â€“ Deep Learning Project in Python with Keras

### What is Image Classification?
The task of identifying what an image represents is called _image classification_. An image classification model is trained to recognize various classes of images. For example, you may train a model to recognize photos representing three different types of animals: rabbits, hamsters, and dogs.

### About Image Classification Dataset

CIFAR-10 is a very popular computer vision dataset. This dataset is well studied in many types of deep learning research for object recognition.

This dataset consists of 60,000 images divided into 10 target classes, with each category containing 6000 images of shape 32*32. This dataset contains images of low resolution (32*32), which allows researchers to try new algorithms. The 10 different classes of this dataset are:

1.  Airplane
2.  Car
3.  Bird
4.  Cat
5.  Deer
6.  Dog
7.  Frog
8.  Horse
9.  Ship
10.  Truck

CIFAR-10 dataset is already available in the datasets module of Keras. We do not need to download it; we can directly import it from keras.datasets.

### Project Prerequisites:

The prerequisite to develop and execute image classification project is [Keras and Tensorflow installation](https://data-flair.training/blogs/install-keras-on-linux-windows/).
